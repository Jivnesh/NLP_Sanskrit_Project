--Creating CNG_groups Edges

--We create a table called Tempgraph which contains each row of graph, that has a CNG along with its CNG Group.
--This is done using inner join of Graph and CNG&CNGG which was made in CNGGroups.ipynb
--We are creatinf tempgraph so that we can use it to created edges of CNG_Groups and other enities using a inner join

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Tempgraph;

FROM Graph t1, 'CNG&CNGG' t2
WHERE t1.Entity_2 = t2.CNG ;

--Inserting edges into graph 
--we do this by taking inner join on Tempgraph and existing graph which. 
--Weights of the edges of CNG_Groups with an Entity are defined as the sum of weights of all the edges with CNGâ€™s of that CNG_group with the Entity. 
--Example: lemma1->CNG1 has weight 6 and lemma1->CNG4 has weight 2. and CNG_Group1 consists of CNG1 and CNG4. weight of edge lemma1->CNG_group1 will be 8(since 6+2)

--CNG_Group to CNG_Group edges are still left
--We will duplicate the values of CNG_Group in TempGraph to another column in the same table,  so that we can group by 2 CNG_Groups to get desired result.
